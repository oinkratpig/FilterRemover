# FilterRemover
Mod for [Empty Shell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2243110/EMPTY_SHELL/). Removes the pixel filter.

Amount of pixelation is also changeable - just edit the .txt that is created by the mod (Same location as plugin).

## Installation

1. Install BepInEx (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
2. Download FilterRemover.dll (https://github.com/oinkratpig/FilterRemover/releases)
3. Place FilterRemover.dll into /BepInEx/plugins/

(optional)

4. Run the game once to generate the config file
5. Locate the config file (blockcount.txt) in /BepInEx/plugins/
6. Change the block count value. I think 5000 looks nice, which is the default of the mod. You can lower the number to make the game more pixelated. Higher values will probably lag more, so if the performance sucks try lowering the value.
