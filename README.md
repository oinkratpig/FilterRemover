# FilterRemover

Removes the pixel filter.

Amount of pixelation is also changeable - just edit the .txt that is created by the mod (Same location as plugin).

## Installation

1. Install BepInEx (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
2. Download FilterRemover.dll
3. Place FilterRemover.dll into /BepInEx/plugins/

(optional)

4. Run the game once to generate the config file
5. Locate the config file (blockcount) in /BepInEx/plugins/
6. Change the block count value. I think 5000 looks nice, which is the default of the mod. You can lower the number to make the game more pixelated.
